## DAA CIA
### <B>DAA CIA1 Sequence Alignment Matrix</B>
Two sequences a and b are chosen and inititialized

Match value and Mismatch value is chosen according to human genes which +5 and -4 respectively

Various traceback mechanism is applied that is Prims ,Djikstra, and Kruskal to obtain the sequence alignment

Affine penalty model is chosen as the scoring model for the sequence allignment matrix

Alignment matrix is not possible to find using the traceback mechanism as prims kruskal and djikstra as we need the same sequence on both vertical and horizontal but 
we are taking two set of different sequences.

### <B>DAA CIA2 DevelopING individual code base using the various evolutionary algorithms for weight optimization
These algorithms used are:
<ul>
<li>Genetic Algorithm
<li>Cultural Algorithm
<li>Particle Swarm Optimization
<li>Ant Colony Optimization
</ul>
